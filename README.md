A front end to the LUCK token ecosystem.
What you can do on the website:
1) Stake LUCK tokens in the LuckBank from the "stake" page.
2) Play the lottery game in the "play" page.

Also there is an "about" page and "contact" page

*Note that I did NOT finish the website, the design is in Figma but I am not a front-end developer and decided to work on other projects*
